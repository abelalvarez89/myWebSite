			This project had its origin when my brother wrote a similar program in C++ to help his girlfriend study.&nbsp 
			This project is intended to help those who want to become a U.S.A citizen. Is specially made for those who are still learning the 
			language. It guarantees to help them since they will read and hear the question/answers at the same time. <br></br>

				<h3><strong>
				 Project Period (1/20/2014 - 4/30/2014)
				 <br></br>
				</strong></h3>	

				<p>
				
				QuikShop is the new easy way to shop, just scan the items you want to purchase with your mobile device and &nbsp 
				when you are ready pay and leave the store. This idea came to me when I was shopping at Walmart and I had to&nbsp 
				wait in line for almost 15 minutes and I only had two small items in my hands, so the question came to me "Isn't&nbsp 
				there a better way to shop?". At that time a new semester just started and one of the course I was taking &nbsp 
				Software Engineering, the professor did not force a project on us he encourage us to find a project on our own.  
				I &nbsp told the group my idea and they liked it so we talked about making sure it became everyone’s idea. We&nbsp
				proposed it to the professor and it was approved, so we started to work on it. We had almost 3 and half month to&nbsp 
				complete what we proposed. We used scrum methodology since it was our first time creating real software and many of us &nbsp
				had to learn new languages like PHP, HTML, JSON, etc. 
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<p>
				The project consisted of a functional website and a mobile app. The way the website and mobile app work is once you log in you have to select the current store you are in, after that just scan items and place it on your shopping &nbsp
				cart. After an item is scanned you can decide what to do with it, you can edit the quantity you want to take, and you can also view items &nbsp
				description and remove items from your cart. Once you are done editing your cart you can pay through you mobile device, after this final step you will receive an email with your items, quantity, price which store you purchased them and total spent.
